I am not sure if I can say that I am not much of a blogger, becasue I have never done it before. Here it goes:

I decided to study Software Engineering because I wanted to change my career. Currently, I am a professional in higher education, however it is no longer something that I have a passion for, but instead is a job that gives me a paycheck. There is no satisfying feeling when I walk into my office, and I miss that.

I come from a family of artists, but I was never able to find a traditional medium that best suited me at the time, compared to my brothers who can pick up an instrument, write a story, or paint a masterpiece. I enjoyed creating my art on a computer. Between graphic design or short films, I enjoyed being able to manipulate and warp images to an exact degree. It is something that I always had a passion for and something that made me feel good. Being able to create something out of nothing just by typing and clicking.

Between that, the trajectory of the age of technology, and covid-19, Software Engineering made the most logical decision for me to try and start a career in. I know that it will be around forever, and I have a chance to create something today that can be used in the next 10, 15, or even 20 years.
