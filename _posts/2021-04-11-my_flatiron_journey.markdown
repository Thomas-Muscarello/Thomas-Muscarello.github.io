It is weird to think that it has been 10 months since I started to become a Software Engineer. I started this path in the middle of a pandemic while working a full-time job, and the future was uncertain. The only thing I was certain about tat the time, however, was that I wanted to change my career to help others on a larger scale.

All of these modules were challenging, some more than others, but being a part of the flatiron community was truly one of the best parts about this 10-month experience. The support I felt going into lectures each week has made me confident in the fact that I can truly become a Software Engineer. 

## Mod 1: Ruby
Mod 1 was my first step in becoming a software engineer and it focused on the nuts and bolts of what code is. It discussed what a class was, and how we used APIs to get information. The hardest part for me was trying to understand the new common words that we would eventually use every week for the following 8 months, such as class, variable, attributes, arrays, etc. This was all very new to me, and there was no big book of definitions provided. I finished this mod by making a project that allowed a user to input information such as city or state and it would pull information from an API that would tell you the breweries in the selected location.

## Mod 2: Sinatra
Sinatra was the first time when we learned that we could basically call it in our terminal and a working app would get created in seconds. I learned how to create a table, and how to migrate it. It was also the place where we focused on MVC (models, views, controllers). Some models could belong to others, while those models can have many of other models. It was confusing at first but eventually it all made sense. Similar to this project, I had my class user and beer models. When I was creating my project for this module, I truly felt like a software engineer for the first time. 

## Mod 3L Rails
The “auto magical-ness” of rails was the biggest challenge I had ever faced, and I still think out of all of the mods, trying to grasp the concept of how routes worked was one of the hardest lessons in this whole program. The “auto magical-ness” of Rails is that it does a lot things for the user behind the scenes, and if you don’t know how to truly use it, you can get lost very easy. Eventually I was able to get a hang of it, and the RESTful routes became my friend. I also learned how to create my own custom routes which came in handy when I wanted to use scope. Creating a Rails API was also super-efficient, especially when I found out how to generate a model with resources, it made everything 10x easier. During Rails, we learned that some models can have models through another models and we were required to have 3 models within out project. For this module I added a posting concept to my users and beers.



# Mod 4: Javascript
Javascript was easily my favorite module. I think this was my favorite because when using JS, you have to be very direct in what you want to create, grab, delete, etc. It wasn’t as auto magical as Rails was, because everything happened right in front of me. It truly introduced front end programming, and I felt like I could be super creative with what I was doing. For this module I created a brick breaker game, and I used a rails backend to keep track of a user with their score. However, I still put my beer themed spin on it by using a Hop as a ball and grain as the bricks. I also learned how to use a canvas a little bit, so which was pretty cool because that wasn’t really a part of the curriculum.

## Mod 5: React/Redux
The final mod. This was what everything was leading up to. Here we learned about components. React allowed us to use JSX which allows us to use HTML in React. We learned what state was and how to pass the state down as a prop from a Parent component to a Child component. I learned how to create a store with Redux which basically acted as a satellite in space that would hold all of the state for my components. That way, if I wanted any component to access the store, I would just have to connect it via {connect} from ‘react-redux’ and mapStateToProps. This basically acted as a beacon for the store within my component. This final project was similar to my Sinatra project as it had just a User and Beer.

## Overall…
This educational journey truly felt like a bootcamp. For the past 10 months I would work my 9-5, and then code for five hours straight every Monday to Friday. I was a part of a community that would meet virtually 3 times a week for about 40 weeks straight (give or take some breaks we would get). There were days when I definitely did not want to code, especially when I would hit a wall, and let me tell you, there were A LOT of walls. However, having this community as well as the live help desk was extremely helpful. 

I also learned that I was never the first one to experience any problem I had coding. I could google or search the error that I was getting and once I hit `Enter`, thousands of solutions would appear. The software engineering community is always willing to help each other out and there is also a lot of code that could be implemented in so many different things. 

I am looking forward to what my future hold and I am very excited to use this new knowledge in a field that is everchanging. Choosing the Flatiron School was one of the greatest decisions of my life.
